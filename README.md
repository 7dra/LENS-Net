## üéà News

[2025.9.15] Training and testing code released.



## ‚≠ê Abstract

Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images (ORSI-SOD) is vital for applications such as urban planning and disaster monitoring. Yet, existing deep models remain energy-intensive and unsuitable for edge deployment. 
We tackle this challenge by proposing  a Low-Energy Spiking Network Neural for Remote Sensing Saliency(LENS-Net), the first fully spiking neural network for ORSI-SOD. LENS-Net employs a Spike-driven Transformer v3 encoder to extract multi-scale features with low energy cost, and a Spike Multi-scale Attention Decoder that fuses contextual cues via spike-driven channel attention and up-convolution, ensuring effective saliency representation under sparse computation. 
Moreover, a {sigmoid-based soft surrogate gradient} replaces hard truncation, stabilizing training and enhancing boundary recognition in complex scenes. 
Across three benchmark datasets (ORSSD, EORSSD, and ORI-4199), LENS-Net demonstrates outstanding performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, outperforming all lightweight ANN counterparts. For instance, on the ORSSD dataset under a timestep T=4 during inference, it achieves a $S_{\alpha}$ of 92.79\%, an $MAE$ of 0.0109, and consumes only 11.48 mJ of energy. These results establish an efficient, low-energy solution for practical ORSI-SOD deployment.
The source code is available at https://github.com/7dra/LENS-Net.

## üöÄ Contribution

- **First SNN-based ORSI-SOD Method**  
  We present the first SNN-based method for ORSI-SOD, filling an important gap and establishing a strong baseline for future neuromorphic research in remote sensing.
- **Novel Multi-scale Spiking Decoder (SpikeMAD)**  
  We design a novel multi-scale spiking decoder termed as SpikeMAD, which incorporates membrane potential residual connections and a multi-scale fusion strategy to achieve efficient and effective feature integration in remote sensing imagery.
- **Soft-Clip Spike Firing Approximation**  
  We propose a soft-clip spike firing approximation backpropagation function that ensures smooth gradient transitions, eliminates discontinuities from hard truncation, and enhances boundary recognition in salient object detection.
- **Extensive Experimental Validation**  
  Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LENS-Net achieves superior accuracy compared to all lightweight ANN counterparts, while consuming significantly less energy (e.g., only 11.61 mJ on ORSSD with T=4).

## 🎈 News

[2025.9.15] Training and testing code released.



## ⭐ Abstract

Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images (ORSI-SOD) is vital for applications such as urban planning and disaster monitoring. Yet, existing deep models remain energy-intensive and unsuitable for edge deployment. 
We tackle this challenge by proposing  a Low-Energy Spiking Network Neural for Remote Sensing Saliency(LENS-Net), the first fully spiking neural network for ORSI-SOD. LENS-Net employs a Spike-driven Transformer v3 encoder to extract multi-scale features with low energy cost, and a Spike Multi-scale Attention Decoder that fuses contextual cues via spike-driven channel attention and up-convolution, ensuring effective saliency representation under sparse computation. 
Moreover, a {sigmoid-based soft surrogate gradient} replaces hard truncation, stabilizing training and enhancing boundary recognition in complex scenes. 
Across three benchmark datasets (ORSSD, EORSSD, and ORI-4199), LENS-Net demonstrates outstanding performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, outperforming all lightweight ANN counterparts. For instance, on the ORSSD dataset under a timestep T=4 during inference, it achieves a $S_{\alpha}$ of 92.79\%, an $MAE$ of 0.0109, and consumes only 11.48 mJ of energy. These results establish an efficient, low-energy solution for practical ORSI-SOD deployment.
The source code is available at https://github.com/7dra/LENS-Net.

## 🚀 Contribution

Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
- **First SNN-based ORSI-SOD Framework**: We propose the first spiking neural network approach for optical remote sensing image salient object detection, establishing a strong baseline and filling a critical gap for neuromorphic computing applications in remote sensing.
- **Novel Multi-Scale Spiking Decoder (SpikeMAD)**: We design an efficient decoder architecture incorporating membrane potential residual connections and a multi-scale fusion strategy, enabling effective feature integration for complex remote sensing imagery.
- **Soft-Clip Spike Approximation for Backpropagation**: We introduce a gradient-friendly spike firing approximation function that ensures smooth gradient transitions, eliminates hard truncation discontinuities, and significantly enhances boundary recognition accuracy in salient object detection.
- **Comprehensive Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LENS-Net achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art lightweight ANN models while consuming dramatically less energy (e.g., only 11.61 mJ on ORSSD dataset with $T=4$).
